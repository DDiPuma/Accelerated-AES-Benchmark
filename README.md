# GPU and ISA-Accelerated Computing for the AES-128 Algorithm

This is a work in progress, but will implement the AES-128 algorithm in C on the CPU, in
OpenCL C on the GPU, and in C with inline assembly to target the x86 AESNI instruction
set extensions.  The goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of GPU-accelerated computing
and of function-specific hardware.
